# Auchan:Direct tech interview

Come and help us build an e-commerce website focused on user experience

## Guidelines

- [duplicate](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/) this repository (do **not** fork it)
- solve the levels in ascending order
- commit your code at least at the end of each level

## What we expect

- clean code
- tests
- comments when you had to make decisions because the spec was not precise enough
- a simple way to run the code and the tests

## Acknowledgements

This test is shamelessly inspired from the drivy test, that I found really great :)
